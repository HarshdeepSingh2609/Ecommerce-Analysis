## 🧠 Goals & Insights

- Perform end-to-end **data cleaning**, **preprocessing**, and **exploratory analysis**
- Use **Pandas** for individual-level ecommerce behavior insights
- Use **SQL** for retail business performance insights across branches and cities
- Understand purchase trends, profit margins, and transaction volume
- Apply SQL functions: GROUP BY, JOINS, WINDOW functions, CASE statements, RANK, and DATE/TIME operations

## 🧪 Workflow Summary

### Pandas (Ecommerce Data)
- Loaded and explored raw ecommerce CSV
- Extracted and cleaned fields like domain, card expiry year, time of transaction
- Applied string, datetime, and grouping operations to extract insights
- Analyzed user behavior based on job titles, email patterns, and browser preferences

### SQL (Walmart Data)
-Cleaned data using python 
- Imported cleaned data into MySQL
- Explored structure using COUNT, DISTINCT, and aggregation functions
- Analyzed store-wise and category-wise sales, profits, and customer preferences
- Used advanced SQL concepts like subqueries, RANK(), CASE WHEN, and DATE functions
